My mother is a dope fiend

My mother smokes paraphenelia as I speak

My mother buys cocaine from a dope man

She loves to smoke that crack pipe


My mother smokes crack rocks

My mother smokes crack rocks

My mother smokes crack rocks

My mother smokes crack rocks

My mother smoked that crack like a cigar

She had a good time at it

She jacks my brother for dope money

She does it by threatening him with a Smith & Wesson

My mother smokes crack rocks

My mother smokes crack rocks

My mother smokes crack rocks

My mother smokes crack rocks

At 11:00 PM, the police came to my mother's house to eject her

They arrested my mother for possession of a controlled substance

My mother was taken to the metal clink

They locked her up for being a loser

My mother smokes crack rocks

My mother smokes crack rocks

My mother smokes crack rocks

My mother smokes crack rocks

Rock over London

Rock on Chicago

Remco, it's the "go ahead and get it" store
